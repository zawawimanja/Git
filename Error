1. Close VS first before add.


#1 computer cannot have 2 user account for git
so for practice with pull request just create a file in github and it will auto init for AccountB
AccountA will fork and the pull request and merge it.

AccountB just add new file in remote but when AccountA try to git pull in local still nothing changes.
